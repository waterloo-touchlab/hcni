title: Workshop on Human-Computer Narrative Interactions @ CHI 2025
---

This workshop brings together researchers from Human-Computer Interaction, Media & Communication Studies, and narrative studies to develop practical, communal knowledge for Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN) design. Our focus is story structures and storytelling techniques that encourage audience interactivity. This shared knowledge will help IDN designers in creating engaging, impactful narrative experiences and guide researchers toward future areas of study.
