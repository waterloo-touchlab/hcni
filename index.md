title: Welcome to the First Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Computer Narrative Interactions!
---

<!-- This workshop brings together researchers from Human-Computer Interaction, Media & Communication Studies, and narrative studies to develop practical, communal knowledge for Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN) design. Our focus is story structures and storytelling techniques that encourage audience interactivity. This shared knowledge will help IDN designers in creating engaging, impactful narrative experiences and guide researchers toward future areas of study. -->

<p>
	Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) are accounts of connected events (a story) represented on digital systems. Through interactivity, IDNs afford ways for users to directly engage with the information embedded in the system’s rules in an accessible manner that taps into the user’s conscious, reflective learning abilities. IDN research is relatively new and there is much to be done to harness IDNs’ storytelling potential, requiring insights from disciplines such as Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Media & Communication Studies, and Narrative Studies. This workshop brings together researchers from these disciplines and other related fields to develop practical, communal knowledge for IDN design. Our focus is storytelling structures, techniques, and traditions that could support digital audience/user-interactions. By developing communal knowledge, we can assist IDN designers in the creation of engaging, impactful narrative experiences and guide IDN researchers toward future areas of study.

<p>
	As work on IDNs requires insights from a wide variety of fields, our primary <a href="objectives">objective for this workshop</a> is to make space for this interdisciplinary work by fostering a welcoming environment that values each field's expertise and insights. This will help build the foundations necessary for a productive and respectful research community. Check out the <a href="activities">activities we have planned for you</a> and lets build these foundations together!
