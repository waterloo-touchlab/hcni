**Geneva M. Smith**, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral scholar and member of the Games Institute and HCI@Waterloo at the University of Waterloo. She develops methods and tools for IDN design and evaluation. Her previous work combined insights from game design, software engineering, affective science, and literary analysis to develop methods for the design and evaluation of generated game character emotions in service to character believability in game narratives.
These are some factors that distinguish IDNs from fixed narratives [ 22 ]. She has presented her work as part of
interdisciplinary panels at conferences for media ecology [28] and interactive storytelling for games [29].

**Lennart E. Nacke**, Ph.D. is the Director of the interdisciplinary HCI Games Group at the University of Waterloo.
A pioneer in games and user experience, he conducts interdisciplinary research on interaction modalities and user
modelling. His extensive work on game user research (e.g. [ 3 , 6]) offers invaluable knowledge for understanding,
designing, and developing IDNs from an Human-Centred Design (HCD) perspective.

**Mark Hancock**, Ph.D. is is Associate Director of the Games Institute, Chair of the Department of Management
Science and Engineering, and Director of the Touchlab at the University of Waterloo. He designs interaction for
games, mixed reality, and multi-touch digital surfaces, with a focus on physical-like 3D interaction. His work on
narrative-specific gestures for digital tables [17 ] and towards creating new and preserving existing narratives of physical
artifacts and curated collections when migrating to digital formats [ 32] are some examples that inform his work on
IDN interaction modalities.

**Lissa Holloway-Attaway**, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in Media Arts, Aesthetics, and Narration and a member
of the Games, Arts, Media, Experience (GAME) Research Group at the University of Skövde, a co-chair of the “New
Media, Digital Cultures and Social Imaginaries in Feminist Posthumanities” research strand at the GEXcel International
Collegium for Advanced Transdisciplinary Gender Studies, and a leading member of the EU COST action INDCOR,
which positions IDNs as a means to communicate complex topics. She conducts interdisciplinary research on a range of
digital media and its varied expressive forms and genres (e.g. [ 8– 10]). Currently, her work centres on social and mixed
media forms that engage issues of performativity, embodiment, (new) materialism and affect, as well as digital cultural
heritage projects that re-imagine the cultural space of the traditional museum and visitor experiences supported by
gaming technologies and playful, mediated encounters. Her interest in emergent media developments and new forms of
digital expression and narrative strategies—from social media, to gaming technologies, experimental literature, mixed
media performance, and virtual and augmented reality—drives her work.
