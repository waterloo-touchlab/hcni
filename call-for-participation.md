Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) are accounts of connected events (a story) represented on digital systems. Through interactivity, IDNs afford ways for users to directly engage with the information embedded in the system's rules in an accessible way that taps into the user's conscious, reflective learning abilities. IDN research is relatively young and there is much to be done to harness IDNs' storytelling potential, and requires insights from disciplines such as Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Media & Communication Studies, and Narrative Studies.

This interdisciplinary, full-day hybrid workshop brings together researchers to begin identifying storytelling structures, techniques, and traditions that could support digital audience/user-interactions from a games-and-play-centric angle to explore interaction design through structured play and how meaning emerges from player-game interactions. This practical, communal knowledge will help IDN designers in creating engaging, impactful narrative experiences and guide researchers toward future areas of study.
